# How to Manage a Garry's Mod Server

Welcome, in this guide I will explain the process of managing a Garry's Mod server properly that can be scaled over time. I am sick of seeing populated servers with horrible development practices so read this guide and fix your shit.

## 1. Github
You will want to use Github for two main reasons, although there are many many more reasons why Github should be used.
1. Github allows you to store a backup for every single update and every single line of code you change. This means, if you fuck shit up, you can easily revert back.
2. Git's source conrol will make working with future developers, or any development you and your team contributes, much easier to manage and deploy as you can have mulitple people working on the same project at a time.

If you plan to hire a developer for any commission work, a Github repository is a MUST.

## 2. Local Dedicated Server
You will want to set up a local dedicated server, this will be your dev server. Any future work YOU do should be done live on this server.

Let me repeat, this is considered your dev server. **You should not be paying for a developer server.**

## 3. DeployHQ
DeployHQ makes it easy to deploy your github repository to the live server. What this means is any updates you or your team makes can be pushed to the live server with a click of a button.




## The Setup

1. Start by creating a Github account if you don't have one already.
2. Create a new Github Organization with your ServerName/CompanyName.
3. Create a new Reposiory for the Gamemode you are developing under that organization.

It should look something like this **github.com/MoonNetwork/DarkRP**

Next we need to set up the local server before going any further with Github.
